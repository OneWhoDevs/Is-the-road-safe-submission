B) 
The data set for the model to distinguish cat image vs dog image was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/data



C) 
I first learned about neural networks, in a basic mathematical sense by learning the formulae to adjust the weights and biases, normalization functions, matrix treatment of each layer, etc. (3b1b vids surely intrigues :) ) 

I took a single hidden layer neural network model as the algorithm, since it used these formulae directly and was programmed into different functions. 
Since it is performing a basic classification problem, i found this algorithm fit. 

In building this I have been intrigued into learning more and maybe building a more optimized and a better performing model (CNN here i come).
